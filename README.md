# purescript-express-todoserver
Purescript ToDoServer example rewritten in a more idiomatic way

Originally located at https://github.com/dancingrobot84/purescript-express/tree/master/examples/src

Rewritten without `foreign import` and in a more idiomatic Purescript style. Uses `Control.Monad.Eff.Ref` for global state management.

May serve as a boilerplate/template for Purescript HTTP services and APIs
